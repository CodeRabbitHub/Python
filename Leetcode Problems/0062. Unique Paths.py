# A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
# The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach
# the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
# How many possible unique paths are there?


class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        row = [1] * n

        for i in range(m - 1):
            newRow = [1] * n
            for j in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
                newRow[j] = newRow[j + 1] + row[j]
            row = newRow
        return row[0]

    def uniquePaths2(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        if m == 1 or n == 1:
            return 1

        return self.uniquePaths(m - 1, n) + self.uniquePaths(m, n - 1)
