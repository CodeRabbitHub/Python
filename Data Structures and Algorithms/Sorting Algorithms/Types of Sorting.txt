There are two types of sorting:

Stable sort: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the contents
does not change  the sequence of similar content in which they
appear, then this sorting is called stable sorting.
Example: Insertion sort

Unstable sorting: If a sorting algorithm after sorting the content
changes the sequence of similar content in which they appear, then
it is called unstable sort.
Example: Quick sort


Popular sorting techniques:
 
 + Bubble sort
 + Insertion sort
