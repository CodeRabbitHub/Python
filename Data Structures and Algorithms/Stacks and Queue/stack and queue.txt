A stack and a queue are both linear data structures that store elements in a linear fashion, but they differ in the order in which elements are stored and retrieved.

A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. The basic operations that can be performed on a stack are push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the element from the top of the stack.

A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. The basic operations that can be performed on a queue are enqueue, which adds an element to the end of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the element from the front of the queue.

Stacks are useful for solving problems that have a natural LIFO behavior, such as parsing, backtracking, and undo operations. They are also used in algorithms such as depth-first search and the evaluation of expressions in reverse Polish notation (RPN).

Queues are useful for solving problems that have a natural FIFO behavior, such as simulation and modeling, scheduling, and breadth-first search. They are also used in algorithms such as the breadth-first search and shortest path algorithms.

Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and the choice of implementation will depend on the requirements of the specific application.
