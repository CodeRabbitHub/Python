# Python

This repository I've started while preparing for data science interviews. I'll keep updating it. The content will be mostly basic programming and data structures in python. 
Advance data Structues and Algorithms which are asked for software engineering roles will not be included here.

01. Leet code Problems on Python basic data structures. Mostly Arrays, Lists, Math's, Dictionaries and Dynamic Programming.
02. Geek for Geeks Problems on Python basic data structures.
