# Data Science Journey with Python

Welcome to my journey as a data scientist! This repository contains my progress in learning and practicing Python programming. My goal is to become proficient in Python, especially in data science and machine learning. I'll be sharing my notes, tutorials, and projects along the way.

## Repository Overview

1. **General Python Programming**: A comprehensive collection of tutorials covering the fundamentals of Python programming, such as data types, variables, functions, loops, etc.

2. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: A deep dive into the different data structures and algorithms used in computer science, implemented using Python.

3. **Object Oriented Programming**: An exploration of object-oriented programming in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

4. **Leetcode Problems**: Solutions to various problems from Leetcode, a popular platform for preparing for coding interviews.

5. **Projects**: Real-world projects that I've worked on, using Python and its libraries for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

## Goal

My ultimate goal is to become a skilled data scientist and make meaningful contributions to the field. This repository serves as a record of my journey, and I hope that it can also be of use to others who are starting out on their own data science journey.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions and feedback from others who are interested in data science and Python programming. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
