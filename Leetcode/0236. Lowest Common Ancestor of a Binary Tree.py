# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between
# two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
# (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
